# Vocabulary Flashcards

A collection of human-curated, machine-readable flashcards for learning vocabulary in foreign languages.


## File format

The flashcards are stored as CSV files without headers. Each file has four columns:

0. The term in the first language.
1. An example usage of the term in the first language (optional).
2. The term in the second language.
3. An example usage of the term in the second language (optional).


## Usage

## Contributions

Contributions are welcome in all forms! Consider fixing spelling, adding new words or even new languages.
